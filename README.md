#Just Eat
Don't know what to eat? Let us find you something random with your preferences.

## Inspiration
Do you find yourself, with friends or family, wondering where to go eat all the time? Sure, we can pull out Yelp or Google Maps, but we'd have too many choices and we'd still waste time choosing.

## What it does
This mobile application will find you a random place to eat based on your location. Of course, you can customize your preferences. After choosing a place for you, it gives you the information you need: address, phone number and the directions from where you are!

## How I built it
Using Android Studio, I built a simple mobile application powered by Yelp and Google Maps.

## Challenges I ran into
Planning and developing alone was my challenge for this hackathon!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The application is simple, pretty and easy to use.

## What I learned
I learned how to use external APIs in an Android application.

## What's next for Just Eat
I will be adding more customization and maybe some machine learning to get to know you, the user.
